# Codes and experiments in PrIsing: Privacy-Preserving Peer Effect Estimation via Ising Model

This GitHub repository contains the codes for experiments presented in our paper *PrIsing: Privacy-Preserving Peer Effect Estimation via Ising Model*. We provide codes for generating Figures $1-12$ (Figure $12$ is in the appendix) in our article. The images and the corresponding codes can be found as follows:

* Experiments in the simulation section are provided in [Simulation folder](https://github.com/anirbanc96/PrIsing/tree/main/Simulations).
* Experiments with real data are provided in [Data/HIV Transmission Network](https://github.com/anirbanc96/PrIsing/tree/main/Data/HIV%20Transmission%20Network) for the HIV Transmission Study and in [Data/PloBlogs Network](https://github.com/anirbanc96/PrIsing/tree/main/Data/PolBlogs%20Network) for the study with Political Blogs Network.

Detailed instructions about the experiments can be found in the corresponding folders.
