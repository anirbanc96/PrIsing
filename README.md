# Codes and experiments in *PrIsing: Privacy-Preserving Peer Effect Estimation via Ising Model*

This GitHub repository contains the codes for experiments presented in our paper *PrIsing: Privacy-Preserving Peer Effect Estimation via Ising Model*. We provide codes for generating Figures $1-12$ (Figure $12$ is in the appendix) in our article. The images and the corresponding codes can be found as follows:

* Experiments in the simulation section are provided in the [Simulations](https://github.com/anirbanc96/PrIsing/tree/main/Simulations) folder.
* Experiments with real data are provided in [Data/HIV Transmission Network](https://github.com/anirbanc96/PrIsing/tree/main/Data/HIV%20Transmission%20Network) for the HIV Transmission Study and in [Data/PolBlogs Network](https://github.com/anirbanc96/PrIsing/tree/main/Data/PolBlogs%20Network) for the study with Political Blogs Network.
* Additional Experiments in Supplement:
  * Codes for Figure $12(a)$ is presented in [Codes/MSEvsEPS.R](https://github.com/anirbanc96/PrIsing/blob/main/Data/HIV%20Transmission%20Network/Codes/MSEvsEPS.R) file, and corresponding results in [Results/MSEvsEpsilon/Social Network](https://github.com/anirbanc96/PrIsing/tree/main/Data/HIV%20Transmission%20Network/Results/MSEvsEpsilon/Social%20Network) folder.
  * Codes for Figure $12(b)$ is presented in [Codes/MSEvsEPS.R](https://github.com/anirbanc96/PrIsing/blob/main/Data/PolBlogs%20Network/Code/MSEvsEPS.R) file, and corresponding results in [Results/MSEvsEpsilon](https://github.com/anirbanc96/PrIsing/tree/main/Data/PolBlogs%20Network/Results/MSEvsEpsilon) folder.

Detailed instructions about the experiments can be found in the corresponding folders.
