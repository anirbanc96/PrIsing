# Simulations with HIV Transmission Network

The experiments with the HIV Transmission Network are provided as follows:
* Code for Figure $6$ is presented in [Codes/NetworkDraw.R](https://github.com/anirbanc96/PrIsing/blob/main/Data/HIV%20Transmission%20Network/Codes/NetworkDraw.R), and corresponding result in [Results/Networks/HIVSocialNetwork.pdf](https://github.com/anirbanc96/PrIsing/blob/main/Data/HIV%20Transmission%20Network/Results/Networks/HIVSocialNetwork.pdf).
* Codes for Figure $7$ is presented in [Codes/DataSim.R](https://github.com/anirbanc96/PrIsing/blob/main/Data/HIV%20Transmission%20Network/Codes/DataSim.R), and corresponding results in [Results/DataBasedSimulation](https://github.com/anirbanc96/PrIsing/tree/main/Data/HIV%20Transmission%20Network/Results/DataBasedSimulation) folder.
* Codes for Figure $8$ is presented in [Codes/MSEBetaNPvsP.R](https://github.com/anirbanc96/PrIsing/blob/main/Data/HIV%20Transmission%20Network/Codes/MSEBetaNPvsP.R) folder, and corresponding results in [Results/MSEBetaNPvsP](https://github.com/anirbanc96/PrIsing/tree/main/Data/HIV%20Transmission%20Network/Results/MSEBetaNPvsP) folder.
